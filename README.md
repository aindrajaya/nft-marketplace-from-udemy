<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the ETH Digital Marketplace
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

So this project is my result of my [Project-based learning](https://www.pblworks.org/what-is-pbl) to explore more deep about Decentralize application that build on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) networks, and to know on how to make Ethereum based Marketplace that supports buy and sell NFTs (collectibles) items. An online marketplace (or online e-commerce marketplace) is a type of e-commerce site where multiple third parties provide products or services.

Here's why and my purpose for this Learning Repository:
* In 2021/2022 NFT is one of the most trending news around the world
* And I also want to know on how Non-fungible tokens have unique attributes and want to know that they are usually linked to a specific asset.
* And NFTs can be used to prove the ownership of digital items like game skins right through to the ownership of physical assets

And not forget to say that NFTs are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated. NFTs can represent real-world items like artwork and real estate. "Tokenizing" these real-world tangible assets makes buying, selling, and trading them more efficient while reducing the probability of fraud.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
